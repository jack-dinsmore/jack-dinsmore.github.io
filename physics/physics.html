            <h1>Inferring Asteroid Shape and Density from Tidal Torque</h1>
            <p>Available on <a href="https://github.com/jack-dinsmore/asteroid-tidal-torque">github</a>. Summer of 2021 to present. Independent project, supervised by Prof. Julien de Wit of MIT.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>In this ongoing project, I model the GCE with multiple luminosity functions, some taken from the literature, and calculate the number of pulsars they require to yield the excess. The paucity of point sources observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope in the galactic center and the fraction of flux from the GCE it observes restrict some luminosity functions. In future work, I will improve the sensitivity of my analysis to determine which luminosity functions best fit point source observations.</p>

            <p>Available on <a href="https://github.com/jack-dinsmore/jtd-gce-urop">github</a>. Fall of 2020 to present. UROP with Prof. Tracy Slatyer of MIT.</p>
            <p>We assess whether the galactic center excess (GCE) can be explained entirely by a largely undetected millisecond pulsar (MSP) population in the galactic center by proposing several luminosity functions, constraining the space of possible parameters with observational data, and predicting how many MSPs are required to reproduce the GCE for each function.</p>

            <p>Available on <a href="https://github.com/users/jack-dinsmore/projects/2">github</a>. Summer of 2020 to present. REU with Prof. Joshua Pepper of Lehigh University</p>
            <p>We developed and tested an algorithm to extract error-corrected luminosity fluctuations from large images of several unresolved open clusters and globular clusters drawn from the TESS data set as a first step to isolating the clusters’ variable stars and determining the clusters’ ages.
            <p>As an REU student, I worked on this problem from its infancy, developing, testing, and comparing different techniques for measuring background fluctuation. I applied these techniques to subtract the background from time series images of stellar clusters and extract position-distributed light curves for a selection of clusters, pinpointing the most variable stars. Working largely independently, I presented my results to my advisor on a weekly basis and to the larger REU group at the end of the summer.</p>
            <p>This project is ongoing, but an article is projected to be submitted just after summer of 2021.<p/>

            <p>Available on <a href="https://github.com/users/jack-dinsmore/projects/1">github</a> and published in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abec21">Machine Learning: Science and Technology</a>. Summer of 2019 to winter of 2019. UROP with Prof. Phil Harris of MIT.</p>
            <p>We sought to increase the speed of event reconstruction in the high-level trigger (HLT) of the Large Hadron Collider CMS experiment by replacing a current, CPU-implemented regression algorithm with a GPU-implemented neural network.</p>
            <p>In 2019, I designed, implemented, and trained a neural network (FACILE) that reconstructs particle energies with TensorFlow on simulated data and I measured its inference speed and accuracy on CPUs, GPUs, TPUs as a function of its design parameters.</p>
            <p>In 2020, we deployed this network as a service and ran the full CMS HLT regression using FACILE, detecting a 10% decrease in total time when compared to the nominal algorithm for under 500 clients. This speedup could be used to increase the throughput of the HLT, or to devote a fraction of the machines currently running the HLT to other tasks.</p>

            <h1>Black Hole Thermodynamics</h1>
            <p>Published in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abec21">Classical and Quantum Gravity.</a> Summer of 2017 to summer of 2018. Internship with Prof. Jennie Traschen of UMass Amherst.</p>
            <p>We demonstrated that the heat capacity of a Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) black hole exhibits an extremum at low temperature and that the entropy exhibits an inflection point at a different low temperature analogous to the classical Schottky anomaly, which occurs in low-temperature two-state systems.</p>
            <p>After a few months of working on a different project, I noticed the heat capacity peak of an SdS black hole and pointed it out to my supervisor, which ignited this project. My role thereafter was primarily to probe aspects of the peak in heat capacity and inflection point in entropy. For example, I showed that they do not occur at the same temperature, and that the entropy inflection point occurs for Reissner-Nordström black holes, which have two horizons like SdS black holes.</p>
