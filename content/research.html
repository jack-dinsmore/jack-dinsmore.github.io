            Save Chandra
        </h3>
        <p>
            NASA's funding for <i>Chandra</i>, the world's sharpest X-ray telescope, was sharply reduced in the most recent NASA budget. This action will severely damage or possibly destroy the twenty-five year pipeline of X-ray photons to science which has sustained thousands of scientists and made many incredible pictures such as those on the left.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many scientists are calling for Chandra's budget to be restored for as long as it is technologically capable of producing great science. See what you can do to help by visiting <a href="https://www.savechandra.org">savechandra.org</a>.

            Pulsar X-Ray Filaments
        </h3>
        <p>
            Several long, thin, "filament" structures have been detected shooting out from nearby pulsars. They're made of electrons and positrons recently manufactured by the pulsar and shooting into the ambient medium at as much as 99.99999% the speed of light.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our twin effort is to find more filaments to characterize them, and build a physical model for the particles' propagation through space. Do they reach Earth? Are the positrons we detect in the upper atmosphere brought to us by these filaments?

        <h3>
            Polarization Leakage
        </h3>
        <p>
            <i>IXPE</i>, the first ever telescope to detect X-ray polarization, opens a new frontier for understanding pulsars and other high energy objects. But X-ray polarization measurements are made difficult by detector systematics that add distorting patterns onto the imaged polarizations (left).
        </p>
        <p>
            I developed a method to predict and subtract this polarization to reveal the true polarization of the source.
