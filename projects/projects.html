        <h1>Throrgan</h1>
        <p>Available on <a href="https://github.com/JackDinsmore/throrgan">github.</a></p>
        <p>Throrgan is an electronic music compiler I started in June of 2021. It reads "throrgan-format" music text files which outline the notes to be played and compiles them into .wav files. It is coded in Rust.</p>
        <p>I started Throrgan in preparation for my next video game adventure, which I plan to write in Rust as well, with the Amethyst compiler. In my previous video game projects, I had always been challenged to find a good soundtrack. It would be lucky indeed to find a set of royalty-free pieces perfectly fitted to the style of my game, and even if I did, I would prefer to compose my own soundtrack. Unfortunately, the free services I could find for producing music either are low quality or involve you playing your own piece yourself. Since I have neither the time nor the inclination to learn piano, I decided to make my own music maker.</p>
        <p>The goal of Throrgan is to be flexible. Unlike other music producing programs, it will allow the user to add inflection to their music by emphasizing certain notes and controlling the virtuosity of the virtual players. The instruments themselves are also customizable. They are stored locally as lists of overtones that accompany the fundamental pitch, and the frequency and volume of these overtones can be tweaked to create different textures of sound.</p>
        <p>Combining these overtones and fundamental pitches for different instruments into a final wav file requires a fair amount of math, as well as optimization. I have not yet completed this functionality, but samples will be forthcoming when I have!</p>

        <h1>Vokdh</h1>
        <p>Available on <a href="https://github.com/JackDinsmore/Vokdh">github.</a></p>
        <a href=""><img src="" width=300px, height=250px, align="left"/></a>
        <p>Vokdh is a word processor designed to help translate and typeset the Fi Tobair language. I started it in July of 2020 and finished it later that summer. It is written in C++, using the Windows API, and therefore can only be run on Windows.</p>
        <p>Fi Tobair is language I created, planning to use it as an alien tongue for a novel I'm writing. It is written vertically and has its own alphabet, which makes it difficult to write via computer. Writing by hand is always an option, but spell correction, printing, and general ease of use are benefits that can only be found on a computer, so I decided to make a custom word processor.</p>
        <a href=""><img src="" width=300px, height=350px, align="left"/></a>
        <p>Vokdh can display English text and transliterated Fi Tobair text as alternating lines, so that each line of Fi Tobair is grouped with its English translation. Mousing over a Fi Tobair word displays its grammatical form and translation, and informs you if the word is gramatically incorrect. Pressing Ctrl-D brings up a dictionary, searchable both in English and Fi Tobair. Words can be added to the dictionary straight from the word processor, and a random word button which forms a random word with the desired frequencies of Fi Tobair's letters is available.</p>
        <p>Other windows display a summary of Fi Tobair grammar in case the user forgets certain details, as well as lists of prepositions and other common words. Finally, a separate window takes the transliterated language available in the main typesetting window and displays it in the Fi Tobair alphabet, so that it can be screenshotted or copied by hand.</p>

        <h1>Poetron</h1>
        <a href=""><img src="" width=300px, height=100px, align="right"/></a>
        <p>Available on <a href="https://github.com/JackDinsmore/poetron">github.</a></p>
        <p>Poetron is a discord bot that recognizes phrases written in meter and repeats them in poetry format. It currently supports iambic pentameter, dactylic hexameter, hendecasyllabic, haikus, elegiac couplets, and trochaic tetrameter. Other meters can easily be added. It is written in Python.</p>
        <a href=""><img src="" width=300px, height=200px, align="right"/></a>
        <p>The idea is simple. Disappointed with the quietness of your server? Want a level above Haikubot? Poetron will repeat any line in one of the above meters whenever a user is seized with an accidental surge of poetic brilliance. It turns out that unintentional poetry is actually pretty common in English, so certain meters can be disabled, and Poetron can be turned off via server commands. Poetron will also describe meters for you, or give you examples if you ask.</p>
        <p>Poetron is finished but still maintained for fixing small bugs. Credit to Mary Dahl for making Poetron's discord icon.</p>
