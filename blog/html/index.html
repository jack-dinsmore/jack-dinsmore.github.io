<button class="collapsible"><h2>Introduction</h2></button><div class="section">

<p>When I was a student, I hated statistics. I thought it was tedious &mdash; a myopic mess of dark magic that blights "Methods" sections across the arXiv, distracting from the core science.
</p>
<p>After just a few years of doing X-ray astronomy, I'm completely converted.
</p>
<p>In my experience, statistics is one the most useful tools a scientist has at their disposal. A good statistical treatment can expose a hidden signal, dismiss false positives, and most importantly form a foundation that's reliable enough to support years of future research.
</p>
<p>I've also learned that statistics is a much more motivated field than I had thought. Especially Bayesian statistics is founded on a few simple principles, and if you simply follow them you will find yourself re-deriving the multitude of \(\chi^2\), \(z\), and \(F\) tests that I thought had to be individually memorized.
</p>
<p>I'm writing this blog to lay out these founding principles of statistics, in the hope that other people will find them as useful as I have. I'll discuss both Bayesian and frequentist statistics, though as an astronomer I'll mostly stick to Bayesian. Several example applications with example Python code will be given, though for educational purposes I'll do my best not to use external packages that do the statistics for you.
