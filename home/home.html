        <h1>Hello.</h1>

        <p>I'm Jack Dinsmore, a physics major at MIT and a programming nerd, writer, calligrapher, builder, and cellist.</p>

        <p>I'm currently working on <a href="../physics">two research projects</a> with professors at MIT, one in the physics department, one in planetary science. In my free time, I'm appying to grad schools in physics and working on a personal project: a music compiler called <a href="../misc/throrgan.html">throrgan</a>.</p>

        <p>In the past, I've worked on five physics research projects and several programming projects including computer games and some more functional code. I've also worked as copy chief for <a href="https://thetech.com"><i>The Tech</i></a> and am now a contributing editor. I played in MIT's orchestra MITSO, and trained high school students o SAT prep in my freshman year under the <a href="http://ati.mit.edu/sat1">MIT ATI</a> program. In high school, I was the student representative to the school committee in senior year and served on the board of my church, the <a href="https://www.uusocietyamherst.org/">Unitarian Universalist Society of Amherst</a>. I also taught a class for 8&ndash;12 year olds at my kung fu school, <a href="https://kungfuofhadley.com/">Shaolin Kung Fu of Hadley</a>.</p>

        <p>You can find my <a href="../files/jack-dinsmore-resume.pdf">resume</a> here, and other information about me in the <a href="../about/about.html">About</a> page.</p>
